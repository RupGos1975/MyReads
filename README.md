Setup instructions:

Install Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Choose from the list of what your operating system is.
The node installation will also install npm.
After installation:
1. Check if node and npm is installed by typing in the command prompt to check for version:
      node -v
      npm -v
   You should see the versions immediately in the next line : For example, v6.11.0 for node and
   5.3.0 for npm if you have installed those versions.

Unzip, Install, and Start:
1. Unzip the MyReads file into any directory, I have unzipped it in the /Users/Udacity directory.
    Mac:
    /Users/Udacity/
    Windows:
    C:\Users\Udacity
2. Open a shell command prompt and CD to the MyReads  
    For example, 
    Mac:
        /Users/Udacity/MyReads
    Windows:
    C:\Users\Udacity\MyReads
3. Next, run the command "npm install" and it will install the create-react-app scripts. 
    For more information on create-react-app, please visit: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app
    https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html
    
4. After successfull installation of the create-react-app scripts, then type the following in the same directory:
    npm start
   This will start a local web server on port 3000, http://localhost:3000. It will launch automatically
   from your default browser.
